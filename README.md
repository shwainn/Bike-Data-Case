# Bike Data Case

# About This Case

This case, presented in the Google Data Analytics Certification Course, describes a bike-share service based in Chicago called Cyclistic. Cyclistic provides bikes for use with single ride passes and day passes, but also provides an annual subscription where members can ride for no extra fee. 

# File Structure

## Cyclistic Script.R

R script, written using RStudio. Some path function may not work outside of RStudio as I used RStudio API libraries to navigate the working directory. It may work outside of RStudio, but I cannot guarantee that. See this file to view the code and/or generate visualizations.

## Bike_Report.Rmd

R Markdown for the report. The report includes visualizations and business recommendations based on the findings, as well as outlines suggested further research. 

## Bike_Report.html 

HTML output of the R Markdown report. Same contents, just nicely formatted using Markdown.

## data folder

Includes source data and .png files of visualizations to use in the report. Since the visualizations took quite a while to generate, I opted to not generate them through R Markdown and generated them beforehand to speed up load times. 

## README.md

Nothing else in this file!
